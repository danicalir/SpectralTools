%% Introduction

% In this exercise, we will analyze a ~1 km^2 portion of a LiDAR dataset
% collected near Merced, CA, by the National Center for Airborne Laser
% Mapping (NCALM). The PIs on the project are Sarah Reed and Ron Amundson
% of UC Berkeley. The main features of interest in the dataset are the
% ubiquitous "mima mounds," (Fig. 1) which are associated with the 
% formation of vernal pools. The terrain contains no trees, and so we will 
% be working with gridded but unfiltered data.
%
% Questions about the mima mounds that we will attempt to answer:
% 
% o What is the characteristic mound spacing?
% o Are there spatial trends in mound size, shape, or organization? 
% o Do these trends correlate with the background topography?
% o How much material has been transported to form the mounds, and how much
%   work was required?
% 
% To address these and other questions, it would be useful to isolate the
% mounds from the background topography. The purpose of this exercise is to
% demonstrate how to use spectral analysis and spectral filtering to
% isolate the mounds and measure their topographic characteristics.
% Specific procedures we will use include:
% 
% o Detrending and windowing of DEMs prior to performing spectral analysis
% o Use of the 2D Fast Fourier Transform to estimate 2D power spectra
% o Identification of quasiperiodic topographic features and measurement of
%   their characteristics, including wavelength, amplitude, and orientation 
% o Spectral-domain filtering to isolate features of interest
% o Windowed spectral analysis to map spatial variations in landform
%   characteristics
% o Optimal filtering to remove noise

% feature at a wavelength of ~10m in the power spectrum.


%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 2. CALCULATE POWER SPECTRUM %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Preprocessing

% Before calculating the power spectrum, we'll make some decisions about
% the preprocessing steps we'll take. If the DEM has a non-zero mean or a
% background slope across the entire grid, this will contaminate the
% spectrum with long-wavelength signals. So our first step will be to 
% detrend the DEM by fitting a least-squares plane to the elevations and 
% then subtracting this fit.
Zo = Z; % Save the original elevations for later
Z = Detrend(Z);
plane = Zo - Z; % Save the least-squares plane for re-trending later

% Second, the fast Fourier transform proceeds fastest if the dimensions of 
% the input matrix are integer powers of two, which we can achieve by 
% padding the DEM with zeros. 
pad = 1; % 1 means pad the data, 0 no padding.

% Third, because the edges of our DEM are not perfectly periodic, the
% spectrum can become contaminated by frequencies used to "fit" the edge
% discontinuity. We can mitigate this effect by multiplying the DEM by a
% function that tapers to zero at the edges.
window = 1; % 1 means window the data, 0 no window

%% 2D FFT

% Calculate the power spectrum using the 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
% Note that the zero padding and windowing happen inside fft2D.
[Pm fm Pv fv] = fft2D(Z,dx,dy,pad,window); 

% A few words about the output from the previous step:
% 
% We have calculated the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) periodogram. This
% is different from the power spectral density, which is also commonly used
% as an estimate of the power spectrum. 
%
% Pm is the 2D power spectrum matrix, and fm is the corresponding matrix of 
% radial frequencies. Pv is a vector version of the power spectrum, and fv 
% is the corresponding vector of frequencies. Units of Pm and Pv are 
% [units of Z]^2, which in our case is length^2 since Z is a matrix of 
% elevations. Units of fm and fv are [units of x]^-1, which for us is 
% 1/length since x is distance. Figs. 3a-e show examples of a simple 1D
% signal and its power spectrum, and Fig. 3f shows an example of a simple
% surface and its 2D power spectrum.
%
% What do the units mean? The periodogram is a measure of how much of the
% original elevation field's variance falls within a given frequency range.
% You can check that the sum of the periodogram is roughly equal to the
% variance in Z. (It will be somewhat less due to the zero padding.)
%
% What about the frequency limits? Wavelength is equal to the inverse of 
% frequency. The shortest wavelength that can be resolved by 2D data is 
% oriented diagonally, and is equal to sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2), or sqrt(2) for 
% our data (Fig. 4). The longest wavelength that can be resolved is 
% infinite in principle, but in practice we wouldn't feel comfortable 
% trying to detect any signal with a wavelength longer than our dataset. To 
% be even more conservative, the longest wavelength we trust should be a 
% few times shorter than the width of the DEM -- a few hundred meters in 
% this case.

% 3. ANALYZE THE SPECTRUM %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% 1D Power Spectrum

% Plot the 1D version of the spectrum (Fig. 5). We'll plot the 2D spectrum 
% a few steps later, but for now it's easier to visualize in 1D.
s1d = figure('Name','Fig. 5: 1D Spectrum','NumberTitle','off');
subplot(2,1,1)
[axf axw] = SpecPlot1D(fv,Pv);

% Do we see anything at a 10m wavelength? Yes, there is a broad peak. The 
% shorter-wavelength peaks are just pixel-scale noise.
hold(axw,'on')
plot([10 10],get(axw,'ylim'),'k')


%% Background Spectrum

% Now let's see what the spectrum looks like in 2 dimensions. If we just
% looked at it as is, we wouldn't see much: as the 1D spectrum shows,
% longer-wavelength signals have much higher power, and would swamp any
% shorter-wavelength detail. To make the 2D spectrum easier to view, we'll
% remove the power-law background trend. Because there are so many more
% points at higher frequencies, we'll bin the 1D spectrum and fit the trend
% to the binned values (Fig. 5).

nbin = 20; % Number of bins
B = bin(log10(fv),log10(Pv),nbin,0); % Bin the log-transformed data

% Plot the binned values
hold(axf,'on')
plot(axf,10.^B(:,1),10.^B(:,2),'ok','markerfacecolor','w')

% Fit a trend with the form P ~ 1/f^n, and plot it
fit = robustfit(B(:,1),B(:,2));
plot(axf,10.^B(:,1),10^fit(1)*(10.^B(:,1)).^fit(2),'k')

%% 2D Power Spectrum

% Use this fit to normalize the 2D spectrum
Pmn = Pm./(10^fit(1)*fm.^fit(2));

% Plot the normalized 2D spectrum (Fig. 6)
figure('Name','Fig. 6: 2D Spectrum','NumberTitle','off')
SpecPlot2D(fm,log10(Pmn));

% The donut of elevated values at radial frequencies of ~0.1 is the
% spectral signature of the mima mounds. It's a donut because the mounds
% don't have a strongly preferred orientation over the entire landscape. 
% The two peaks very close to the center of the square correspond to the 
% NW-SE-trending valleys, and the sharp features aligned with these peaks 
% at higher frequencies are probably harmonics.

%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 4. FILTERING %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% High-pass filter

% Now let's isolate the signal associated with the mima mounds. From our 
% 1D and 2D spectra, it appears that the peak associated with the mounds
% begins at frequencies of ~0.03 to 0.05 m^-1 (wavelengths of 20 to 30m). 
% The mounds are only a few pixels wide, so we want to retain all 
% frequencies higher than about 0.04. We can accomplish this with a
% high-pass filter.

% Define the transition frequencies for the filter: floHP is the frequency 
% at which the high-pass filter starts to increase appreciably above zero. 
% fhiHP is the frequency at which it reaches 1.
% floHP = 1/100; fhiHP = 1/15;
floHP = 1/50; fhiHP = 1/5;

% Plot the filter alongside the 1D spectrum to illustrate its shape (Fig. 
% 5). Note how the filter transitions smoothly from 0 to 1 -- the shape is 
% half a Gaussian in linear frequency.

ShadePlot(dim.x,dim.y,Zhp)

%% Low-pass filter

% What's left over is the low-pass-filtered topography (Fig. 8)
Zlp = Z - Zhp;
lp = figure('Name','Fig. 8: Low-pass-filtered DEM','NumberTitle','off');
ShadePlot(dim.x,dim.y,Zlp)
% We could also do the low-pass filtering with the following:
% floLP = floHP; fhiLP = fhiHP;
% Zlp = SpecFilt2D(Z,dx,dy,[floLP fhiLP],'lowpass');


%% Remove channels

% Note that the mima mounds are not the only features in the
% high-pass-filtered topography: channels are also short-wavelength
% features. We could try to use a band-pass filter to eliminate the
% channels, but their width is close enough to the mound wavelength that we
% would risk eliminating important details of the mounds. Instead, we'll
% try to remove them in the spatial domain by exploiting the fact that they
% are concave-up features with low elevations. 

% Before calculating derivatives, "re-trend" the data by adding the 
% least-squares plane back in
Zlp = Zlp + plane;

% Calculate derivatives of the low-pass-filtered topography 
[DX DY] = gradient(Zlp,dx,dy); 
DX = -DX; % Correct for the fact that y is positive up
G = sqrt(DX.^2 + DY.^2); % Magnitude of the gradient
D = atan2(DY,DX); % Direction of the gradient vector (aka aspect)
C = 4*del2(Zlp,dx,dy); % Laplacian

% Create a binary grid of channel locations and set elevations in those
% locations equal to the mean of the rest of the grid.
Cmax = 0.01;
Zmax = 0;
chan = C > Cmax & Z < Zmax;
Zhp(chan) = mean(Zhp(~chan));

% Display a shaded relief map of the result (Fig. 7)

%% Remove edge effects

% You can also see some edge effects produced by the removal of long 
% wavelengths. Let's clip these off.
c = 30;
xclip = c:Nx-c; yclip = c:Ny-c;
Zhp = Zhp(yclip,xclip);
Zlp = Zlp(yclip,xclip);

% 5. WINDOWED SPECTRAL ANALYSIS %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Windowed 2D FFT

% Now that we have isolated the mounds from the background topography, we
% can investigate how they vary across the landscape. The spectral analysis
% we performed previously only provides a measure of average mound
% characteristics across the entire DEM, but the lidar data is sufficiently
% dense that we can compute multiple spectra within smaller windows across
% the DEM, and derive a measure of mound characteristics within each window.

xstep = 10; ystep = 10; % Distances between successive window positions
[ic jc wavelength angle variance] = ...

% It's noisy, but the clustering around the 1:1 line suggests that the

%% How much energy is required to form a mound? 
% If mounds are formed by transporting soil from troughs to peaks, then a 
% rough estimate of the work W required to build a mound is
% W = rho*g*V*h
% where rho is soil density, g is gravity, V is the volume of soil moved
% from trough to peak, and h is the vertical distance the soil's center of
% mass was displaced, which is roughly equal to half the mound height:
%         __
%  /\  /\ __ h
% /  \/  \
%
% If the mound wavelength is lambda, then V ~ h*lambda^2. So our estimate
% of the work required to build a mound is:
rho = 2200; % density in (kg m^-3)
g = 10; % gravitational acceleration (m s^-2)
h = sqrt(variance); % Standard deviation (m), an estimate of h

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% A noisy DEM

% What if we want to eliminate, rather than isolate, a component of a
% surface? Noise removal is a common filtering operation, and there is an
% optimal way to construct the filter. 

% Add some Gaussian noise to the elevations in the spatial domain to create 
% a noisy DEM (Fig. 16)
sigma = 0.2; % Standard deviation of the noise in meters

%% Noise estimation

% Next, we manually identify parts of the spectrum that appear to be
% dominated by noise. The high-frequency end of the spectrum is flat, the
% expected trend for white noise (Fig. 17).
imeas = 1:20; % Bins that correspond to the measured spectrum (all of them)
inoise = 17:20; % Bins that are dominated by noise

% Extrapolate the inferred noise spectrum to parts of the spectrum that are
% dominated by signal. In this case, we can capture the assumed shape of 
% the noise spectrum pretty well with a constant value.
noise = 10.^min(B(inoise,2)) * ones(size(fm));

% Fit a smooth surface to the measured spectrum by interpolating linearly
% between the binned values.
measured = interp1(B(imeas,1),B(imeas,2),log10(fm));
measured = 10.^measured; % Transform back to linear spectral power

% Plot the measured and inferred spectra (Fig. 17)
plot(axf,fm(:),measured(:),'+k')
plot(axf,fm(:),noise(:),'+b')

%% Filter construction

% Estimate the true signal spectrum by subtracting the estimated noise
% spectrum from the measured spectrum. The optimal filter is then 
% constructed by taking the ratio of the estimated signal spectrum to the
% measured spectrum. The filter will be nearly 1 at frequencies where the 
% spectrum is dominated by signal, and nearly zero where it is dominated by
% noise -- just what we want.
signal = measured - noise; 
F = signal./measured;
F(F==Inf | F==-Inf) = 0; % Correct elements where we just divided by zero

%% Noise removal
