function [ic jc w q v] = fftWin(M,dy,dx,ywin,xwin,yshift,xshift)

% [ic jc w q v] = fftWin(M,ywin,xwin,yshift,xshift)
%
% Performs a windowed spectral analysis of the matrix M, using a window of
% size [ywin xwin] points. The window is moved in increments of yshift and
% xshift points in the y and x directions.
%
% Returns:
% ic and jc, vectors of row and column indices of the window centers
% w, matrix of weighted peak wavelengths
% q, matrix of orientations of peak wavelengths (degrees CCW from E)
% v, matrix of variances of M within each window
