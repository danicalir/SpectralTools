2DSpecTools for Matlab v1.1
2010/07/06

These Matlab functions perform 2D spectral analysis of gridded topographic data following the procedures described in Perron, J.T., J.W. Kirchner and W.E. Dietrich (2008), Spectral signatures of characteristic spatial scales and non-fractal structure in landscapes, Journal of Geophysical Research - Earth Surface. Please acknowledge the use of this software in any publications by citing this paper.

All code is intended for use with Matlab. The included script mima.m illustrates the use of the included functions. See comments in individual m-files for more details. For help with any function, type 'help [function name]' at the Matlab prompt.
